# Google Translation Service
I built this using my TempAPI project and then added the Google services needed, detailed below.

 - Create a free trail on the Google Cloud https://console.cloud.google.com/
 - Next create an app on the Google Cloud under your account
 - Enable Translation API for your app https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?project
 - create service account key and download it
 - reference key in the translation controller
